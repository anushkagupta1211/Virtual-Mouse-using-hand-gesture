# Virtual-Mouse-using-hand-gesture
The main objective of the virtual mouse system is to control the mouse cursor functions by using hand gestures instead of using a physical mouse. The proposed system can be achieved by using a webcam or a built-in camera that detects the hand gestures and hand tips and processes these frames to perform the particular mouse functions.
